# react-crx-template

Template for creating Browser Extensions with React

## Make it your own

- [ ] Update the extension's name and description on `package.json`.
- [ ] Update the extension's name and description on `manifest.json`.
- [ ] Update the icons in `./public/icons`. You will need provide a 128x128 icon. The other sizes are optional but recommended.

## Limitation

Currently build a single React app. This can be used as a popup or a side-panel but not both.
